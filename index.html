  <h1>Who am I?</h1>
  
  <p>
    My name is Pierre Fabre, I'm a French engineering student in control theory soon to graduate from ISAE-Supaéro!

  <h2>Work</h2>
 
  <p>
    As mentionned before, my field is control theory. I'm a huge fan of the work of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ControlLectures">Brian Douglas</a> 
    the famous author of the <a href="https://engineeringmedia.com/map-of-control">Map of Control Theory</a>.
    I want to use my skills in control theory to help people have a better life and make this world a better place just like people from <a href="https://www.wandercraft.eu/">Wandercraft</a>
    do it by helping disabled people walk again with an exosqueleton.

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  
  <p>
    I like to solve problems whether it's solving boulder problems in a gym or outdoor in the Fontainebleau forest,

    or solving chess puzzles everyday on chess.com,

    <figcaption><i>I like this one, can you solve it?</i></figcaption>
  </figure>
    
  <p>
    or even solving engineering problems for fun projects like the furuta pendulum we built with <a href="https://armandpl.com/">Armand du Parc</a>.

  <h2>M.D.R.S.</h2>

   <p>
    In February 2022, I took part in a mission in the Mars Desert Research Station. It's a Mars Analog research facility in the Utah Desert. 
     My 5 crewmates and I stayed 3 weeks in this facility without contact with the outside performing Extra Vehicular Activities and experiments for labs and companies.

  <p>
    During this mission, I was the crew's journalist. My misssion was to write reports of each day both in English and in French. 
    This task was crucial because this was the only news our family had from us.
    I enjoyed so much writting those reports. You can find them all on the <a href="https://mars.bde-supaero.fr/en/crew-240-2/">website of the mission</a>.
    We also have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@m.a.r.ssupaero3072">YouTube channel</a> you can check out!

  Here is an extract from the report of Sol 1
  </p>

<figure>
    <blockquote cite="https://mars.bde-supaero.fr/en/sol-1-first-steps/">
        <p>10:04:50 : « ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one… » the door opens and the light comes in. 
          After a flash that blinds me for a moment  my eyes start to accommodate to the light and I can see the red colour of the sand and the rocky mountains in the background through the open door. 
          « Welcome on Mars » says the Hab Com. The goosebumps get me. At this moment, I can’t contain a smile. This is the first result of two years of hard work that were truly worth it. 
          A little thought to Raphael our botanist who would have loved that view and we step out of the station and land our first foot on the red soil of Mars. We dreamt so many times of this moment and now it’s real. 
          But now we have to focus on our destination, the reason for this EVA. Marble Ritual is waiting for us!</p>
