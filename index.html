  I'm a French robotics control engineer working at <a href="https://www.wandercraft.eu/">Wandercraft</a> on the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@brutofficiel/video/7395226248059866400">first self-balancing personal</a> exoskeleton. 
  In the past I've also interned at <a href="https://www.safran-group.com/companies/safran-electronics-defense">Safran</a> as a control engineer intern and at <a href="https://www.laas.fr/en/">LAAS-CNRS</a> as a control theory research assistant.
  I studied at <a href="https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en">ISAE-Supa√©ro</a> where I had the opportunity of perform a <a href="https://pierfabre.github.io/2024-08-07-mdrs/">Mars Analog mission</a> during 3 weeks in the Utah Desert!
  I like to solve problems whether it's solving boulder problems in a gym at Arkose or outdoor in the Fontainebleau forest, solving chess puzzles on chess.com or even solving engineering problems for fun projects like the <a href="https://pierfabre.github.io/2024-08-07-furuta-pendulum/">furuta pendulum</a> we built with <a href="https://armandpl.com/">Armand du Parc</a>.
